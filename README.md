In this case study, you will perform essential data preprocessing steps on the Penguins dataset. The
dataset contains information about different species of penguins, including their physical characteristics and the region where they were observed. Your goal is to prepare the dataset for machine
learning analysis. Follow these steps: 1. Load the penguins dataset using the code snippet provided
below. 2. Perform initial data exploration to understand the dataset’s structure, features, and any
missing values. Summarize the dataset’s statistics and gain insights into the data. 3. Address
any data quality issues, such as missing values and outliers. Decide on an appropriate strategy for
handling missing data, such as imputation or removal of rows/columns. 4. Analyze the relevance
of each feature for your machine learning task by using the learned use feature selection technques.
5. If the dataset contains categorical variables, encode them into a numerical format suitable for
machine learning models. 6. Split the dataset into training and testing subsets to evaluate the performance of your machine learning models. 7. Scale or normalize the numerical features to ensure
consistent scaling across variables. 8. Apply suitable dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce
the size of the data while preserving important information. 9. Validate your preprocessing pipeline
by training and evaluating a machine learning model, such as the Random Forest model, on the preprocessed data. Compare the results to the model trained on the raw data (before feature filtering,
transformation, and reduction) to ensure that preprocessing has improved model performance.
